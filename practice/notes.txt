ðŸ”¹ transforms.ToTensor()
This is where the conversion happens ðŸš€

transforms.ToTensor() does two things:
- Converts the PIL image (0â€“255) into a PyTorch tensor.
- Normalizes the pixel values from 0â€“255 into the range 0â€“1 (by dividing by 255).
So after ToTensor(), each MNIST image is now:
A tensor of shape (1, 28, 28) (1 channel, 28 height, 28 width).
Pixel values are floats in [0, 1].
